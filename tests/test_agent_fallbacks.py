"""Every agent must degrade to its fixture when no model is available.

This is what keeps CI green without AWS credentials. Owner: Sorour.

Every test that drives the model path patches BOTH `llm.available` and
`llm._complete`. `text()` short-circuits on `available()` long before
`_complete` is reached, so patching only `_complete` makes the test pass on a
laptop with ~/.aws/credentials and fail on a credential-free runner.
